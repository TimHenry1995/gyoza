For the Documentation:
- From within your project root folder, call the terminal command "sphinx-quickstart docs" and make sure you enter all required metadata in the dialogue
- Replace the generated conf file with your own.
- Ensure you have a .readthedocs.yaml file that instructs readthedocs on how to install your library
- Update the version in conf.py of docs AND update version number in pyproject.toml to the same number
- Inside docs directory delete all files that are created by the command sphinx-apidoc -o docs src/gyoza to make sure they will be overidden next
- From within the project directory call sphinx-apidoc -o docs src/gyoza
- Ensure the conf.py has the following code at the top of the file
  import os, sys
  for x in os.walk('.'):
    sys.path.insert(0, x[0])

  for x in os.walk('..'):
    sys.path.insert(0, x[0])

  for x in os.walk(os.path.join("..","..")):
    sys.path.insert(0, x[0])

Ensure conf.py has theme 'sphinx_rtd_theme', ensure extensions = ['sphinx.ext.todo','sphinx.ext.viewcode','sphinx.ext.autodoc']
